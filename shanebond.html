    <h1>A Great Fast Bowler</h1>
    <div class="para">
    <p>1.Bond had minimal exposure to cricket and he even made his first-class debut at the age of 21 years 
        and 7 months in January 1997, which is considered relatively mature.<br><br>
        2. Three seasons after playing first class cricket for Canterbury, Bond joined the New Zealand Police, 
        as a result of which he had to quit his career in cricket.<br><br>
        3. He made his international debut on 22nd November 2001, against Australia in a Test match at Hobart. 
        It was a disappointing debut as he recorded figures of 1/135 while Australia piled on 558 runs. <br><br>
        4. His ODI debut in January 2002 was rather more successful as he picked up three wickets for 53 runs, 
        helping New Zealand defend a low total of 199 against the Aussies.<br><br>
        5. He continued his great form in ODIs as he was the leading wicket taker in the VB Series a month 
        later, picking up 21 wickets at an economy of 16.38.<br><br>
        6.He first came into the spotlight in the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup, as he rattled Australia’s top order 
        in the Super Sixes match, picking up an impressive six wickets, conceding only 23 runs. However, his efforts 
        went in vain as Australia’s pace rival Brett Lee also toppled New Zealand’s batsmen and Australia won the match by 96 runs. <br><br>
        7. After two years of absence from cricket due to injury, Bond came back with a bang in a Test match against Zimbabwe, as 
        he picked up his first 10 wicket haul. He maintained his form, as he picked up a career best figures of 6 for 19 in an ODI against India.<br><br>
        8. However, his best performance came against West Indies in the Test match at Auckland on 9th March. West Indies had to chase only 291 to 
        win the match, and were set up for a victory when Bond rattled the middle order, picking up 5 for 69, which included a duck by Brian Lara. <br><br>
        9.Injury prevention.<br><br>
        10. Bond is the fastest New Zealander to get 50 wickets in Test matches, a feat he accomplished in 12 matches. He is also the fastest New 
        Zealander to reach the 100-wicket mark in ODIs, and second only to Saqlain Mushtaq in the world. <br><br>
        11. Bond was appointed as New Zealand’s bowling coach in October 2012. He was credited with enhancing the performances of Tim Southee 
        and Trent Boult. He left the position after the 2015 ICC World Cup, where New Zealand made it to the final but lost to Australia.<br><br>
        12. Since then, Bond has been the bowling coach of Mumbai Indians in the IPL. He is set to be the bowling coach of Chennai Super Kings from 2018. <br><br>    </p>
