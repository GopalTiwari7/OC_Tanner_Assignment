        1. He was noticed in junior cricket at a very young age of 13 years. He represented Baroda in U-14, 
        U-15, U-16 and U-19 teams well below the age limit. He also played for India U-15. He was brilliant 
        with both bat and the ball and his performances kept getting better. <br><br>
        2. He was then given a chance in the U-22 team. He returned with figures of 4/71 and scored 44 against 
        Saurashtra. This performance made the selectors elevate him to the India Emerging Players squad. <br><br>
        3. Irfan made his international debut in a Test match against Australia on 12 December 2003 in Adelaide. 
        It did not go well for him as he took 1/160 and scored only 1 run in the match. He was dropped in the next match. <br><br>
        4. He again got a chance two test matches later, but again he failed to impress with figures of 3/106 in the match. <br><br>

        order and scored a few half centuries batting at no. 3. <br><br>

        took 4/37 and 3/38 in other matches of the series and got two Man of the Match awards. <br><br>
        8. He also performed in both the departments in Test cricket. His then-Test-best score of 93 runs again came against Sri Lanka and 
        set up the match for India. His fifties in Test cricket were like bonus for the team. <br><br>
